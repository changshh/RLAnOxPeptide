**RLAnOxPeptide: An Integrated Framework Combining Transformer and RLfor Efficient Antioxidant Peptide Prediction and Innovative Design.**

A groundbreaking integrated framework, RLAnOxPeptide, is poised to accelerate the discovery and design of novel antioxidant peptides. By synergistically combining the power of Transformer architecture and reinforcement learning, this innovative tool offers an efficient solution for both predicting the antioxidant potential of peptides and generating entirely new, high-activity candidates.

At the heart of RLAnOxPeptide lies a sophisticated model that leverages the deep learning capabilities of Transformers to understand the intricate patterns and relationships within peptide sequences that govern their antioxidant properties. This predictive power is then enhanced by a reinforcement learning component, which intelligently explores the vast chemical space to design novel peptides with optimized antioxidant activity.

This dual-pronged approach of prediction and generation streamlines the traditionally time-consuming and resource-intensive process of identifying and developing effective antioxidant peptides. Researchers and developers in the fields of functional foods, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals can now harness this powerful tool to rapidly identify promising peptide candidates and design bespoke molecules with enhanced efficacy.

To facilitate wider access and application, the RLAnOxPeptide framework has been made publicly available through an interactive online platform. Users can directly engage with the tool to:

Predict the antioxidant activity of their own peptide sequences.

Generate novel antioxidant peptides with desired characteristics.

We have deployed the RLAnOxPeptide project on Hugging Face to provide a powerful and efficient platform for antioxidant peptide analysis and design.

Main Platform (Full-Featured)
This platform offers comprehensive tools for the activity prediction and de novo design of antioxidant peptides. As it is hosted on Hugging Face's free dual-core CPU tier, the peptide generation feature can be slow. The prediction feature is not affected.

Online Demo & Model Weights: https://huggingface.co/spaces/chshan/RLAnOxPeptide

Base ProtT5 Model Used: https://huggingface.co/Rostlab/prot_t5_xl_uniref50

Fast-Generation Platform (Simplified)
To address the slow generation speed on the main platform, we have built a separate, faster model based on a simplified Transformer, specifically for the de novo design of peptides.

With this suite of tools, we hope to open new frontiers in the development of next-generation antioxidant therapies and functional health ingredients.
